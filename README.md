This is a recipe app that uses the alamofire library to make HTTP request to the REST API and swiftyJSON library to return JSON data.
Each item has an unique generated key
The data will then be populated into the tableview by the "title" id
The user can add new recipes, edit the descriptions, and also removing them as well.
